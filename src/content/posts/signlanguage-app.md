# SignLanguage – Making ASL Education Accessible, Interactive, and Fun

American Sign Language (ASL) is a vital form of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community — but traditional learning methods can be slow, outdated, or inaccessible. That’s why our team at **Webdrip** decided to create **SignLanguage** — an open-source mobile app designed to make learning ASL **practical, engaging, and powered by AI**.

## 💡 The Problem

Learning sign language often requires formal classes, repetitive video tutorials, or reading books that lack interactivity. Many tools don't support **practice-based learning**, which is essential for mastering gestures, speed, and fluidity.

We wanted to solve this by offering a **hands-on, AI-enhanced experience** — accessible from any device, open to everyone, and free to use.

## 🎯 Our Vision

The goal was to build a **gamified, interactive platform** that:

- 🖐️ Detects and evaluates hand gestures using machine learning
- 🎥 Includes a large library of ASL phrases with video support
- 🎮 Uses **quizzes and games** to make learning more fun
- 📱 Works on both Android and Apple devices

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🎬 20,000+ ASL Phrase Videos

Explore a massive collection of video content that demonstrates real-world ASL usage, taught phrase-by-phrase.

### 🔤 Learn the Basics with ML

Start with **A-Z alphabets and numbers 1-10** using real-time **hand detection powered by machine learning**.

### 🎮 Quizzes & Games

Reinforce learning through AI-powered mini-games and interactive quizzes that test your recognition and form.

### 🍏 Cross-Platform Support

SignLanguage is now live on the web and **compatible with Apple devices** — making ASL learning more accessible than ever.

### 🧪 Coming Soon: Phrase Detection

We’re working on new features like **automatic phrase detection** — so you can practice, get feedback, and improve in real-time.

## 🌐 Open-Source for Impact

SignLanguage is not just a product — it’s a **community-driven initiative**. We’ve made the entire codebase public so that others can contribute, localize, or extend it to other sign languages around the world.
